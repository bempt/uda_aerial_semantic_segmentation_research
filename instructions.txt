@Segmentation Models PyTorch  Look through the code in this project and tell me which elements have not been completed yet. Order them logically in order of recommended completion using machine learning and engineering best practices. Do not write any code yet.

Continue with the next logical 1 step in the project development. The test_system is currently functioning properly, so you may add functionality but must not remove functionality without asking for the user's explicit permission. Remember to change the test_system in lockstep with any changes to the system.
---
Verify that the step that you were working on has been entirely completed (Implement proper Tensorboard integration for all phases). If there is additional work to be completed to finish the step, order the actions logically in order of recommended completing using machine learning and engineering best practices. Do not write any code yet.
