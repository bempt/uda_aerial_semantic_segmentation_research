PROJECT VERIFICATION:

Look through the code in this project (@repo_structure.yaml and @flattened_repo.txt) and tell me which elements have not been completed yet. Do not write any code yet.

Architecture Implementation:
  - PyTorch
  - Able to import Github repo (PC running Ubuntu 22.04) to Google Colab and have Jupyter Notebooks run without issues
  - Multi-phase UDA aerial semantic segmentation model
  - Multi-class semantic segmentation
  - ResNet50 encoder (all phases)
  - UNet decoder (all phases)
  - Tensorboard integration
  - Copies of model for each run saved with logs for further training, testing, and ablation studies.
  - Auto-stopping to prevent over-training.

Phase 1 (Semantic Segmentation) Requirements:

STEP VERIFICATION:

- Look through the code in this project (@repo_structure.yaml and @flattened_repo.txt ) and tell me which elements have not been completed for this step ().

- Do not write any code yet.

CODE:

- Continue with the next logical 1 step in the project development ().

- @test_system.py  is currently functioning properly, so you may add functionality but must not remove functionality without asking for the user's explicit permission.
- Remember to change test_system.py in lockstep with any changes to the system.
