- Conducted comprehensive code review to identify incomplete elements
- Identified major gaps in Phase 3 implementation
- Found missing components in results visualization and metrics tracking
- Noted incomplete dataset handling and training infrastructure
- Highlighted need for better documentation and testing
- Added test section for Phase 3 (Unsupervised Fine-tuning) components in test_system.py
- Implemented tests for consistency loss, strong augmentation, and domain confusion metrics
- Fixed Config class by adding missing MODEL_NAME attribute required by test_system.py
- Added NUM_EPOCHS parameter to Config class with default value of 100 epochs
- Added get_strong_augmentation function to augmentation.py with enhanced augmentation pipeline for unsupervised learning
- Fixed dependency conflict by constraining numpy version to be compatible with imgaug
- Added ConsistencyLoss class to losses.py with KL divergence-based consistency loss for unsupervised learning
- Created setup_test_data.py to handle test data preparation with dummy data generation
- Updated augmentation pipelines to use current albumentations transforms instead of deprecated IAA transforms
- Updated DroneDataset class to properly pass named arguments to albumentations transforms
- Updated TargetDataset class to properly pass named arguments to albumentations transforms
- Added resizing functionality to TargetDataset to handle images of different sizes
- Fixed mask tensor type conversion in DroneDataset to ensure Long type for PyTorch
- Fixed augmentation parameters and added helper function for consistent return types
- Updated test_system.py to properly test augmentations with correct input/output handling
- Added comprehensive domain adaptation metrics tracking with confusion metrics
- Added update method to DomainAdaptationMetrics for batch updates
