- Project includes a system for tracking user prompts and project evolution through text files
- Modified .cursorrules to ensure text files are appended to rather than overwritten
- System maintains three key files:
  - instructions.txt: Records all user prompts
  - summary.txt: Maintains an evolving project summary
  - README.md: Tracks new file additions with descriptions
- Added dataset management to .gitignore:
  - Excludes main dataset directories
  - Preserves sample datasets for development
